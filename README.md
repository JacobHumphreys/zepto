A simple black-box clone of the pico text editor written from scratch using zig.

## Motivation
As an exercise of writing slightly more complex software in zig, I decided to attempt to create
a text editor without using any external libraries. This project makes use of libc and the zig 
standard library in order to replicate the functionality of the unix pico text editor.
